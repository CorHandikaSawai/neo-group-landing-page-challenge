-   **Images** are inside `assets/images`, mostly using WebP for better compression.
-   **CSS is modular**, separating concerns (e.g., `card.css`, `cta.css`) inside `styles/components/`.
-   **If the project were bigger**, I would have used **HTML partials** for reusable components.

## ðŸŽ¨ Styling Approach

-   **No strict framework** â€“ I just **winged it** and made adjustments based on ChatGPT suggestions.
-   **CSS prefixes** were added using an **online CSS prefixes tool** to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
-   **Animations & Effects** are applied using CSS transitions and Alpine.js.

## ðŸ“· Image Optimization

-   Used **WebP** format where possible to reduce load times.
-   Kept **JPEGs for larger images** when necessary.

**Overall, this project focuses on simplicity, lightweight assets, and smooth animations.**
